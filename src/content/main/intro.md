# Welcome to UMass Embodied AGI Lab!

Our goal is to develop **embodied intelligent agents** capable of understanding and interacting with the world in a human-like manner. By combining physical and social intelligence with advanced models, we aim to push the boundaries of embodied general intelligence for virtual and real-world environments.

Our research areas include: **Spatial Intelligence**, **Social Intelligence**, **Embodied World Model**, **Generative Robot Agent**, **Physics AI**, and **Multi-Agent Systems**
