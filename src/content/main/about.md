# Welcome to Embodied AGI Group!
Our goal is to develop intelligent agents capable of understanding and interacting with the world in a human-like manner.
By combining physical and social intelligence with advanced models, we aim to push the boundaries of embodied general intelligence for real-world and virtual environments.
